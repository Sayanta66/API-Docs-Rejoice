Python libraries and frameworks
---------------------------------

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can help you build applications more efficiently. Some popular ones include:

1. **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
#. **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures like DataFrames, which are ideal for handling structured data.
#. **Matplotlib**: A plotting library that allows you to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

.. note :: 

    These libraries are widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing, making Python a popular choice in these fields.

1. Numeric List
#. is auto-numbered
    #. use line above
        a. or single space in alignment
        #. various numbering options
    #. sometimes '#' fails
    #. so use numbers
#. here '#' works though.
